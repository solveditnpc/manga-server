  <Summary>Vlad was a vagrant child of the slums who always admired knights. After an incident where he was struck by black lightning, he began hearing a voice. A knight of blue moonlight appeared one day, and Vlad's back-alley life was turned upside down... Even an obscure star that does not shine in the highest peaks of the night sky is still a star if it wishes to shine.</Summary>
